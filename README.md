This website serves as an introduction to who I am Sean Stanley R. Davidson  showcasing my strengths, achievements, skills, personal interests, and contact information. It provides an overview of my personality and invites visitors to explore different sections to learn more about me. While creating this portfolio was enjoyable, it presented challenges, especially with hosting on platforms like GitHub and 000webhost. Despite being familiar with HTML, managing repositories, pushing code, and configuring hosting were new experiences for me. I also faced issues with uploading files and making my site public on 000webhost. After consulting my brother, who was more experienced with these tools, he helped me resolve technical issues, including creating a GitHub repository and connecting it to 000webhost. Though the process was difficult, the final result was a successful portfolio that marked an important step in my growth as a web developer, teaching me valuable lessons and inspiring me to continue expanding my skills.
